# HOW TO RUN TEST

# 1) Enter bash shell

# If you haven't started the container
# docker-compose up -d && docker-compose exec rmq_lab /bin/bash

# If you have started the container (where the string is from your other bash shell e.g. jovyan@a492aec1d9b)
# docker exec -it a492aec1d9bb /bin/bash 

# 2) Run python script
# cd Producer-And-Consumer/producer/
# AMPQ_URL="amqp://guest:guest@rabbitmq:5672/" python3 publish.py

# Once you spin up both the producer / consumer you should see the following
# output in your consumer terminal
# [x] Received Message: b'Success! Producer And Consumer Section Complete.'
